Loren's Feedback:
Looks like a good project. Make sure to make full use o what features of Haskell and which new libraries you bring in - a simple game of life simulator is a little too simple for what we're looking for.
Bhakti's Feedback:
Looks good! Consider using the brick library (or something similar) for visualizations on the command line; it might make your tasks easier.

Score: 3/3
